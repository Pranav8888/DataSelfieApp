# DataSelfieApp
## This Web Application needs to be deployed locally in order for it to work. This cannot function through GitHub pages.

## Description
This Web Application allows users to take draw pictures(or "selfies") along with some metadata like location and time. This allows users to keep track of their "selfies" and build a collection of them.
